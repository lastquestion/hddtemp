Template: hddtemp/SUID_bit
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should /usr/sbin/hddtemp be installed SUID root?
 You have the option of installing hddtemp with the SUID bit set,
 allowing it to be run (reporting hard drive temperatures) by regular
 users and not only the superuser.
 .
 This could potentially allow hddtemp to be used during an attack
 against the computer's security. If in doubt, do not choose this option.
 .
 This setting can be modified later by running 'dpkg-reconfigure hddtemp'.

Template: hddtemp/syslog
Type: string
Default: 0
_Description: Interval between hard drive temperature checks:
 The temperature of the hard drive(s) can be logged by hddtemp via
 the generic system logging interface.

 Please enter a value in seconds corresponding to the interval between
 two checks. To disable this feature, enter 0.

Template: hddtemp/daemon
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should the hddtemp daemon be started at boot?
 The hddtemp program can be run as a daemon, listening on port 7634
 for incoming connections. It is used by some software such as gkrellm to get
 the temperature of hard drives.
 .
 You have the option of starting the hddtemp daemon automatically on
 system boot. If in doubt, it is suggested to not start it
 automatically on boot.
 .
 This setting can be modified later by running 'dpkg-reconfigure hddtemp'.

Template: hddtemp/interface

Default: 127.0.0.1
_Description: Interface to listen on:

 interface, or on all interfaces.
